There is used line buffering in both programs. The output will be written after receving "\n" and the buffer will be cleaned.

Program 1 puts to the buffer "Hello" and then puts "\n".
So the program will print "Hello\n" twice (before and after fork)
Output:
----------------------
	Hello
	Hello
----------------------
While Program 2 puts to the buffer "Hello" and then "\n".
So the program will print "Hello\n" and "\n"
Output:
----------------------
	Hello

----------------------
