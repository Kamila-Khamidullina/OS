Three strategies of dealing with deadlocks:

1) Recovery:
Deadlock recovery is used in real-time operating systems (deadlocks depend on the user actions);
This strategy is not such expensive as others;

2) Prevention:
This strategy is used if one of four conditions occur:
- mutual exclusion: avoid assigning a resource
- Hold-and-Wait: processes should be required to request resources before execution or to first temporarily release resources
- No-Preemption: virtualizing or taking back resources
- Circular Wait Condition: process is entitled a single resource at any moment

3) Avoidance:
This strategy is used if certain information (for example, safety of a granting resource) is available in advance
